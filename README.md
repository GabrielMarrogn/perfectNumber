In mathematics, a perfect number is an integer for which the sum of all its own positive divisors (excluding itself) is equal to the number itself. For example the number 6 is perfect, because 1+2+3 is equal to 6. Your task is to write a program that read integer numbers and print a message informing if these numbers are perfect or are not perfect.
